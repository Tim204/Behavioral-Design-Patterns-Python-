TEMPLATE  PATTERN: NOTE: I implemented the entire pattern on the same file- task.py

There are basically TWO ways of Implementing this pattern. You can either use Inheritance Or Polymorphism.

The Polymorphic approach brings us back to using the strategy pattern

Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class
and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.

Identification: Template Method can be recognized if you see a method in base class that calls a bunch of other
methods that are either abstract or empty.
