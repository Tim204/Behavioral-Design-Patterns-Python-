Mediator Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows us to reduce the unordered dependencies between the objects.
In a mediator environment, objects take the help of mediator objects to communicate with each other.
It reduces coupling by reducing the dependencies between communicating objects.
The mediator works as a router between objects and it can have itâ€™s own logic to provide a way of communication.

Design Components:
Mediator: It defines the interface for communication between colleague objects.
Concrete Mediator: It implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleague objects.
Colleague: It defines the interface for communication with other colleagues
Concrete Colleague: It implements the colleague interface and communicates with other colleagues through its mediator.
